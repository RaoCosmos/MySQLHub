# SQLHub

Welcome to my SQL & Data Analytics Hub!
This repository is a collection of projects where I explore sports analytics, business problems, and data harmonization challenges using SQL and related data tools. 
Each project demonstrates how I structure queries, design schemas, and apply analytics techniques to uncover insights.
